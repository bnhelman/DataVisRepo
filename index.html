			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> How does money flow differently between the different sized investors? How is property distributed?</li>
					<p>I would expect institutional and large investors to be buying up a lot of properties since the article said “Institutional and large investors are
						buying up large swaths of properties at a discount and flipping them at a premium, further adding to the rapid increases in prices around the region”
						(MAPC, https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report). But we don’t get an idea about small and medium investors and how the interact with non-investors. Also we don’t know what happens in this submarket, do things flow through all channels or do firms only trade with others of their size?</p>
				<li>Are specific homes more likely to be commodified than others in a time correlated way? Is there some transition point where once a property is commodified by getting flipped once, then that house continues to be used as a commodity? In other words, does an investor purchase set off a cascade of further investor purchases?</li>
					<p>After flipping, the price is higher than it once was, pricing out regular people. This comes from the idea that, “We see the large gap in median prices start to form after the Great Recession and peak in 2020. Second, homes that are flipped are re-sold at a higher price, significantly higher when an investor is doing the flipping (as shown in Figure 19). These dynamics combined—purchasing at a discount and flipping at a profit—make it hard, if not impossible, for an average family to purchase in the market.” (MAPC, https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report). Is it then true that the people who would be willing and able to buy these houses are primarily other investment firms? The expectation would be that once a house is flipped, it moves primarily between investors. Additionally, since “investors are likely to purchase properties from the existing housing stock instead of more expensive new construction. This further leads to the existing, more naturally affordable housing stock moving out of reach for the typical buyer.” (MAPC, https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report). So does a submarket of these homes exist?</p>
				<li>What impact does Freddie and Fannie Mac have on wealth contraction in the Boston Housing Market? How is the liquidity actually being provided to the market?</li>
