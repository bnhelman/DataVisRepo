			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> How does money flow differently between the different sized investors? How is property distributed?</li>
					<p>I would expect institutional and large investors to be buying up a lot of properties from MAPC's article saying, “Institutional and large investors are
						buying up large swaths of properties at a discount and flipping them at a premium, further adding to the rapid increases in prices around the region”
						(MAPC, https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report). But we don’t get an idea about small and medium investors and how the interact with non-investors. Also we don’t know what happens in this submarket, do things flow through all channels or do firms only trade with others of their size?</p>
				<li>Are specific homes more likely to be commodified than others in a time correlated way? Is there some transition point where once a property is commodified by getting flipped once, then that house continues to be used as a commodity? In other words, does an investor purchase set off a cascade of further investor purchases?</li>
					<p>After flipping, the price is higher than it once was, pricing out regular people. This comes from the idea that, “We see the large gap in median prices start to form after the Great Recession and peak in 2020. Second, homes that are flipped are re-sold at a higher price, significantly higher when an investor is doing the flipping (as shown in Figure 19). These dynamics combined—purchasing at a discount and flipping at a profit—make it hard, if not impossible, for an average family to purchase in the market.” (MAPC, https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report). Is it then true that the people who would be willing and able to buy these houses are primarily other investment firms? The expectation would be that once a house is flipped, it moves primarily between investors. Additionally, since “investors are likely to purchase properties from the existing housing stock instead of more expensive new construction. This further leads to the existing, more naturally affordable housing stock moving out of reach for the typical buyer.” (MAPC, https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report). So does a submarket of these homes exist?</p>
				<li>What impact does Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have on wealth contraction in the Boston Housing Market? How is the liquidity actually being provided to the market?</li>
					<p>In the propublica article, there is tension between what Freddie Mac claims to do and what it actually does in practice. For example, the article simultaneously says, “A Freddie Mac spokesperson said that more than 95% of rental units backed by loans Freddie has purchased deliver market-rate rents that are affordable to low-, very-low- and middle-income households” while also claiming, “Private Equity Firms Were Behind 85% of Freddie Mac’s Biggest Apartment Complex Deals”  (Vogell, https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord). So I should be able to verify one of the statements independently using the actual Boston housing data. Does the spokesperson’s claims misrepresent reality in the Boston market?</p>

			<h2>Data Cleaning Summary</h2>
			<h4>Only the most important points are listed here for brevity and readability. Full details and justifications for the data manipulations are in Appendix A. Individual sections have their own cleanings if necessary.</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Prices below $10,000 were filtered out as outlier or family transactions</li>
				<li>Excluded properties with latitudes and longitudes outside of Boston (See Appendix A and the note on spatial transformations below)</li>
				<li>Verified the existence of $100M+ purchases as legitimate by address</li>
				<li>Noted that many sales included a buyer with 0 owned properties. Determined these were likely legitimate purchases from unknown/untracked buyers and not first time buyers (see Appendix A). Left these in, but removed them in 1 notable visualization</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Advanced Data Transformations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Latitude and Longitude Recovery: There were ~450 entries where the latitude and longitudes were entered as (0, 0). I determined that these were likely legitimate purchases by checking their address against their zip, then seeing if the price was reasonable for a sample. I noticed that an entry having a (0, 0) was correlated with their price and zip code.
					Removing them would have introduced a statistical bias because of this correlation and the number of entries. Therefore, I generated corrected latitudes and longitudes for these properties using their address as a reference and updated their entries.
				</li>
				<li>
					Inflation Adjustment: The prices were at time of sale, which means that if I want to fairly compare (real) prices across different years, then I must adjust for inflation.
					I retrieved the CPI-U for our dates using a base year of 2000 dollars. Then I adjusted every entry using the CPI for that entry's year and month. I didn't interpolate for the day.
					I did not adjust the profits from each sale or the annularized values, but I also did not use this data in my visualizations.
				</li>

			<h2>Overview and Introduction to the Data</h2>
			<p>
				Let's look at all the points from a more familiar lens, the Boston Map. We can then understand how the data is spread out in space and get a useful reference point for the following analysis.
				If we mark the prices, we should be able to see some trends we might expect like expensive high rises near Downtown Crossing/Government Center. 
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/Price_Map.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Map of Boston overlayed with property purchases and their price distribution. Larger, redder circles represent larger purchases to help reweight the data by cash and contrast expensive vs inexpensive areas.
				Represents the whole dataset from 2000-2022 (minus filters discussed above). The data is mostly between Fenway and the Downtown Waterfront, and north of South End. Many notable areas like Allston, South Boston, parts of West End, and Sea Port
				are not represented in the data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				And yes, it appears that we can note some trends we might expect from a Boston real estate map. Downtown Crossing and Government center are notably expensive, and the areas of North End and the transition to South End are cheaper.
				However, many neighborhoods have very little data in this dataset. In general, the data represented focuses on the most urban areas of the city.
			</p>

			<h4>How does the Market Trend? And how does it compare to Inflation?</h4>
			<p>
				We expect housing to be getting more and more expensive year after year. This is one of the most common analyses done, but let's ask how it relates to my questions. One can look at housing prices as a place to live or as an investor. 
				If you're looking at housing prices as a place to live, then price increases signal that it's becoming increasingly difficult to afford a house. However, some of my questions relate to investors, so I would like to visualize prices
				in a way an investor would look at them. From my personal experiences, investors care about how assets appreciate and how this compares to inflation. So let's investigate house prices in Boston through the lens of appreciating assets instead of places to live.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Price_Line_Chart.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Increases in median housing price in the Boston area over time. The darker green curve has been adjusted for inflation to yr 2000s dollars (i.e real price) while the lighter green curve was not adjusted for inflation (i.e nominal price).
				The shaded distance between the green curves and the black horizontal reference line gives the appreciation the median house has experienced since 2000.
				The shaded region between the light and dark green curves represent the nominal appreciation that can be attributed solely to inflation.
				We can conclude that real estate has appreciated relatively steadily since 2000, even accounting for inflation. An investor would care about the
				real return on investment (real ROI), which would have been 80% in total over the 22 years.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The idea of a house as an appreciating asset rather than a place to live is a key idea for investors. This is of course why housing investment is popular in the
				first place. Not only does the asset appreciate, it also pays dividends in rent collection.
			</p>

			<p>
				If we want to think about houses as a currency of sorts, we should understand how the denominations are distributed. How are properties broken down by price? 
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/General Distribution of housing prices.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Number of distinct properties broken down by price bin. The size and color of each bubble corresponds to the number of distinct addresses falling into that bin. If an address was bought multiple
					times, then the most recent value after being adjusted for inflation was used. Surprising to see an uptick in the $1,000,000-$5,000,000 group, but likely the values are too spread.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Tot_owned_market_share.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Breakdown of money spent in the real estate market by number of houses owned (including purchase). The size and color of the box corresponds to the total amount of money each group of people spent from 2000 to 2022. 
				We see that most of the purchases are done by entities buying their only property. However, all entities who own 2 homes at some point purchased 1 home previously, so we expect single home owners to be 
				over represented. Additionally, many people sell their home to buy another one, which also inflates the single ownership.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Okay, so while entities often own just one home, we don't know who the entities are yet. An entity that owns 5 homes could be a medium investor or simply a profoundly wealthy individual.
				We should understand how the market breaks down along those lines so we know who is actually doing the buying. It is also interesting to see how these trends change over time. From the
				readings, we should expect large institutional investors like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to be buying in big. Maybe this will give us a clue into my question on how Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are operating in Boston.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor Market Share adj.png"" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Investor vs Non-Investor Purchasing. The categories of investors have been broken down by color into small, medium, large, and institutional based on the MAPC criteria listed in their article. In brief, investors
				are categorized by meeting either a minimum number of houses owned or minimum cash spent. The length of the bar represents the amount of money spent by that group in the year bin. The data has been broken out by time bins of 5 years. The years 2020-2022 have been excluded because 
				they would be underrepresented in a total due to only having 3 years of purchasing.

			<h2>Investor Flows</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_Flows_1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Flow of cash and properties between types of investors. The left column of each chart represents the identity of the seller of a transaction. The right column in each chart represents the identity of the buyer of the transaction.
				The area of the flow corresponds to the amount of cash or property exchanged. We note that, surprisingly, the different kind of investors primarily move assets among themselves. We notice that a notable exception is that small investors
				and non-investors often exhange assets as an exception to this rule.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The above graphs reveals a trend that I would not have expected. In general, investors "stay in their lane," trading only with firms that are of similar size to their own. This is an answer to one of the original questioned I asked "how does money flow differently between the different sized investors?"
				<b>It would appear that there are in fact sub markets where investors are primarily buying from similar investors</b>. Why might this be? One explanation could be that different sized firms achieve different economies of scale for managing buildings. This agrees with the reading where 
				larger firms can extract a higher profit margin. To investigate this further we would need to break down the flows by purchase price.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was also surprised to see that non-investors still dominate the number of properties exchanged, even if they are losing in the cash value of those sales. This is based both on the readings claiming that investors are buying tons of property and also
				because of the previous figure showing that investors are dominating in amount spent recently. This raises the same followup question of "What kinds of properties are the different kinds of investors buying?"
				One explanation could be that although intitutional investors are buying few properties, they're buying expensive ones such as large buildings. Then in the data this might only count as a single property, but actually houses many apartments.
				So to answer this question, we should further categorize these flows through channels identifying the price of the property being purchased.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_Flows_2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Flow of cash and properties between types of investors, now categorized by property price. The left column of each chart represents the identity of the seller of a transaction, the middle column represents the amount paid for the property, and the right column in each chart represents the identity of the buyer of the transaction.
				The area of the flow corresponds to the amount of cash or property exchanged. We see that institional investors primarily deal with the >$20,000,000 transactions. Then the investors down the food chain purchase cheaper properties in similar proportion.
				Non-investors are well distributed among the types of properties but fall off when the price is >$5,000,000. We notice that the bulk of the property flow is on properties less than $1,000,000, which explains the discrepancy between property number and total spent.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>This is in retrospect unsurprising. One of the definitions we used for categorizing investor size was the amount the spent. So by definition investors buying expensive properties would be larger.</p>

			<h2>Flipping</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Flipping_Map.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Map depicting the explosion of flipping practices across Boston. Each pink dot represents a home that was bought within the time range then flipped.
					The left map shows 2000-2004, where we notice few flipping occuring. Then, the right graph depicts 18 years later where we see greatly increased quantity
					of flipping in 2018-2022. The current flipping is occuring in most of the geographic areas of Boston that we have tracked in our data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Do certain houses flip more? </p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Bar_Flipping.png" alt="" />
			</figure>


			<figure>
				<img src="images/Pie Charts.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Chance of an apartment getting flipped again represented as both as bars and pies. The chance that an apartment will be flipped is 1.6x higher if it was already flipped once.
				If it was already flipped twice, it still has a 1.3x higher likelihood of being flipped again than normal.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				I've included two visualizations because they tell slightly different stories. When placed on top of each other, the bar graph highlights
				the difference to make it obvious that the chances are different. 1.6x and 1.3x more likely are pretty obvious on a bar graph. However, we were interested
				in whether a submarket exists for these homes to be continually flipped. When put on pie charts, the percentages are still there but its much less profound because we lose the contrast of the data being stacked right next to each other.
				I also note the samples size on the pie chart, which was significantly decreasing due to the nature of taking a small percent of a small percent. So the pie chart provides some caution against only looking at contrast.
				In the previous sections, we saw a submarket (investor size) that was nearly completely trading within itself. Here the difference is small relative to the effect we saw there. So I come to the following conclusions:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>It is more likely for a flipped property to be flipped again</li>
				<li>Continuously flipped properties only constitute a weak submarket. This does not occur at a high enough rate (in only 9.27% of cases) for this to constitute an strong submarket.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Influence of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae</h2>
			<p>
				The data conveniently has a flag for whether the property was bought/sold by a Government Sponsored Entity (GSE). In their metadata, they say this simply means that the buyer/seller was Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.
				So as a first step lets look at this data
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/GSE_Low_Numbers.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Number of properties owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae each year. Each blue box represents a single property. In total, there are only 34 properties, a surprisingly small number. There are also no numbers after 2015.
				The purchases are heavily concentrated around the years during and following the recession (2008-2012).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Based on the propublica article, I was expecting that there would be a huge number of Freddie Mac and Freddie Mae properties. For example, the article says that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae participated in many deals in recent years that
				were, "The deals were massive, involving thousands of apartments and multiple states" (propublica, https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord). So where are all those houses?
				It's not just that there are a small number of purchases in recent years, there are absolutely 0 since 2015. The chances that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were purchasing thousands of houses and not one was in this dataset
				are astronomically low. Something is awry here.
			</p>

				This line of reasoning led me to
