			<h3>Immediate insights</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Looks like spiral is growing</li>
				<li>If I squint it kind of looks stretched in the “y=x” direction. So in the summer and winter</li>
				<li>There’s a peak in 2021 January</li>
				<li>2020 had nothing until March</li>
				<li>Peak right now in Jan 2022 -> January might be a bad month for covid</li>
				<li>Troughs in 2021 June and November, 2020 September</li>
				<li>Seems to be getting worse over time</li>			
			</ul>

			<h2>Critique</h2>
			<p>The graphic does a few things well, in particular, it is well targeted to the audience, especially given the context of the time. The first impression the graphic makes is to get an emotional reaction by analogy. The common viewer is likely to see this data as “spiraling out of control” because it uses a literal spiral, and the viewer is likely to understand this point at a glance even if the details are a bit messy. From reading the rest of the article, I think the designers intentionally try to make this apparent. An important plus for this “at a glance” impression is that it’s different from just a line chart. At the time, we were inundated with tons and tons of line charts, and in my personal experience, many people stopped looking at them. By having some novel representation, I assume people would be more likely to stop and look at it instead of skimming. Therefore, it’s well targeted for the intended audience. By wrapping the timeline, they’re able to fit more information into the same width than a linear timeline. One effect of this is that the graphic does a decent job of not fearmongering. By placing this spike in context with past ones, we get a frame of reference from our previous experiences. This aligns with our history, “we’ve had a few spikes before” while still guiding the inference, “but it looks like this one is going to be pretty bad.” I think it encourages informed caution without panic. Mechanically, I appreciated the location and sizing of the “7-day average” label. Most people wouldn’t care about this, and it stays out of the way for them. But for those who do care, they would look for it and then it would show up. This happened to me, where I didn’t care then right at the time when I thought about how they calculated this, I noticed the 7 day average. Unfortunately, the dates are the same size as this out of the way label.</p>
			<p>The main issue I have with the design is that it’s not immediately obvious where I should start reading. Common pop culture typically depicts “spiraling in” in the sense of a “downward spiral” for which a common first look would try to read this by going outside in. I think the arrow does not do enough to show the direction. That being said, I understand the tradeoff of having the larger areas towards the outside. Unfortunately, It took me too long to get the direction and see the months delineating the seasons. It’s clever, but I didn’t immediately recognize the year cycle, which is a very important part of the design. I think this is a significant failure and I would be willing to trade some things in to recover this. Also many people have different mental images of how the years wrap. In my mind I actually see January on the x axis with the seasons going clockwise. This is simply because this is how it was shown to me in preschool. I appreciate that I can see the whole history of the pandemic, but it seems like the article is actually only focused on January 2022. That takes up very little of the visual space. Without reading the article, I would not have guessed that this visualization was actually trying to make a prediction rather than analyze past trends. I had no idea they were talking about Omicron. However, in the context of the time, most people would probably already be aware of it. While they gain a good “at a glance” effect, they trade in ease of comparing the scale of the graph, which I find hard to understand. Yes, they have a legend, but I see this at the end after I’ve already looked at the graph for a while. It’s unclear whether the width of the legend is referring to the biggest point being 150k or that specific width being 150k. This scales the data in different ways, so I think this is a more severe failing. I would put the scalebars into the diagram itself. Even among relative values, it is still difficult to compare because I must mentally translate and rotate widths through space. For example, does February 2021 or October 2021 have more cases? It’s difficult to tell.</p>

			<h2>Sketches</h2>

			<h3>Sketch 1</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="A3_images/sketch_1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Sketch 1
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<ul>
			<li>
				Wanted to begin by making minimal changes to the original graphic aligned to what I identified in my critique.
			</li>
			<li>
				I used the following priorities to fix it:
				<ol>
				<li>Clarify direction of spiral (and order of reading)</li>
				<li>Convey that we want to make a prediction for Omicron</li>
				<li>Make the passage of time in months more obvious</li>
				<li>Clarify the absolute scale</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The design choices for each aim were the following:</p>

			<ol>
			<li>Spiral direction + start</li>
			<ul>
			<li>
				Added a ton of arrows to establish a single direction eyes would move <span class="muted">or “track”</span>
				<ul>
				<li>Allows me to constrain natural orders to read the graphic in</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				Have 2 exceptional points: Center of the graph + Prediction area of graph
				<ul>
				<li>
					These are the two places eyes are drawn to begin reading. Other areas will quickly shuttle the eyes to the prediction section via the arrows.
				</li>
				<li>This is actually undesirable — ideally there is only 1 natural entry point.</li>
				<li>
					However, this was a carefully determined trade-off with priority 2 + 3 where I leverage the arrow tracks to make both readings work.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have Jan, Feb, March, April, but no May; white space breaks the circle, returning to center.
				</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clarify Omicron Prediction</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Added whole prediction section</li>
				<li>Differentiated by color to be noticeable</li>
					<ul>

					<li>Tradeoff: Opens second undesirable entry point</li>
					<li>Mitigated by constraining the eyepath so they at least understand the timeline quickly</li>
					<li>
						Added indirect way to convey uncertainty by extending the highlighted region outside the line.
						<ul>
							<li>This isn't great because I am mixing my visual encodings a little.</li>
							<li>Made the prediction dashed to help emphasize we don't know for sure.</li>
							<li>Nevertheless, even though I break some rules, I really like it.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Added when Omicron entered US</li>
					<li>I do not do a good job of clarifying what cases are Omicron, only total cases</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			<li>Make Months Obvious</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Made text bigger</li>
					<li>
						Added February &amp; March to connect Jan &amp; April
						<ul>
							<li>This is a continuation of the track direction, so the reading occurs naturally</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Did not add other months because I wanted to control the natural place along the track that someone sees the months.
					</li>
					<li>
						Did not do a good job of breaking into seasons. I considered adding symbols, but it just added to visual clutter.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<li>Clarify Scale</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Put the scale on the diagram itself (disambiguates)</li>
					<li>
						Did not work so well because it crowds the upper left corner. But I must use a width of 150k which only happens in certain spots.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			</ol>

			<h3>Sketch 2</h3>

					Sketch 2
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Goals and Priorities</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
				Do something novel but kind of fun and maybe not so serious
				<ul>
					<li>Relates to keeping reader's attention when they were overloaded with Covid data</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Give people a touch point to understand the numbers</li>
				<li>Explore a linear timeline</li>
				<li>Get an emotional reaction but try to at least be a bit objective — no weird data manipulation etc.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				While I personally like this graphic, it has some very notable issues that I should address first.
			</p>

			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Not expressive: I don't represent all the datapoints because I had to switch over to a monthly average of daily cases rather than a continuous 7 day avg.
				</li>
				<li>
				Easy to misinterpret daily numbers for monthly numbers because I have discretized by month. The most natural reading would be to assume these are monthly sums.
				<ul>
					<li>Tried to mitigate this by:</li>
					<li>Highlighting Daily in Red to match the points</li>
					<li>Including the text at the bottom to guide interpretation</li>
					<li>
					Additional consequence of this is I have to use first week's data for Jan instead of a monthly sum so again it raises questions
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Didn't capture any predictions</li>
				<li>Easy to misinterpret this as simply Vermont Covid numbers.</li>
			</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>
				<strong>Do something interesting</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Chose to make a weird premise “what if we moved everyone to Vermont” to grab viewer’s attention</li>
					<li>
					Included the graphic to help people understand what I was doing
					<ul>
						<li>Shows mapping explicitly through the 5 dots getting squished into Vermont.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The US Map and Vermont Map were hand drawn with no trace! Pretty eye catching</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
				<strong>Give people a touchpoint for the values</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Decided to use a state because people aren’t good at understanding orders of magnitude.</li>
					<li>
					Originally I was going to use the least populous state, Wyoming, but that is just a box.
					Vermont is similarly populated and has a much more interesting silhouette. Also, it’s mostly vertical which is good for fitting data.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
				<strong>Try a linear timeline</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Huge amount of data to fit across 1 page this way</li>
					<li>Chose a landscape aspect ratio</li>
					<li>Broke the timeline into 2 parts to fit more on page</li>
					<li>Connected with line to maintain continuity</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
				<strong>Get an emotional response</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Used a charged red color</li>
					<li>Represented the population density so it was reminiscent of bacterial colonies</li>
					<li>
					Had the red dots explode out of Vermont
					<ul>
						<li>Kind of “you might be next”</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Included the sentence at the end.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Sketch 3</h3>

					Sketch 3
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h4>Sketch Goals</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to mess with sketch 1 in a few ways</li>
				<li>See if color can help</li>
				<li>Get the natural direction of "top" to be in the center and "bottom" on the outside</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Actions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Tried a gradient to give a sense of shading, it looks terrible</li>
				<li>Red is not a good gradient color for this design</li>
				<li>Added a guide 100k cases line in grey, its hard to track and adds to visual clutter</li>
				<li>Tried to reduce clutter by deleting the inner envelope, just doesn't look right</li>
				<li>Thought about using bins of case amounts to color code regions of severity</li>
					<ul>
						<li>actually not a bad idea</li>
						<li>this could allow for comparison along points of the chart without needing to rotate the data</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
				The main sense of identity I wanted to preserve when altering this design was that it would be a good intro graphic on a New York Times article. 
				This means leaning towards minimalism, trying to keep annotations few, authoritative phrasing, and being eye-catching. 
				I wanted people to stop scrolling to read my pretend article. 
				I further contextualized my analysis towards catering to viewers living in 2022. 
				The spiral is very well fit for this because it serves three purposes: to be novel, to represent a calendar over multiple years, and to pack in data more densely than a linear timeline. 
				As I mentioned in my critique section, people were overwhelmed by graphics at the time, meaning an interesting graphic like the spiral stood out among the crowd, likely making people actually read it. 
				Whereas the spiral before was an emotional worry, because we have more data, here it’s more like the spiral eyes emoji, maybe conveying a tiredness of sorts. 
				In my second sketch, I did try to make a broken linear timeline, but it was simply too difficult to fit all the data into it, and I lost most of the sense of seasons. 
				I added annotations for the Delta and Omicron outbreaks because I felt that this would allow people to better place each part of the graph in context with their own experiences. 
				I made a huge black center dot to give a starting point and I removed the center crossing of the grid so that it didn’t compete for attention in the center. 
				I felt that the areal encoding of the case number along with the darker lines in the original design was compelling and good for snapshotting a lot of data quickly, so I went with their choices. 
				I also went with their 7-day average because it smoothed the data out and kept the attention on trends rather than noise when I tested removing it. 
				Unfortunately, this graphic does not do a good job of comparing values directly because of the need to rotate the data through space for comparison. 
				This was a price I paid to have novelty. The beginning area of covid is downplayed in particular because of the radius scaling of area in polar coordinates. 
				This makes the beginning seem less important and more obscured. Although with recency biases, maybe it isn’t so bad to emphasize the most recent data.
			</p>

			<p>
				From my sketches and critiques I targeted 3 criteria I specifically wanted to improve that I felt was worth moving away from minimalism for. 
				In order: to know where to start reading and how to continue, know that it’s a calendar, and know what scale thickness corresponds to what number of new daily cases. The first sketch was foundational to all of these, in which I designed a single natural track for the eyes to follow using arrows. 
				In this final  graphic, I have placed arrows along the path to both give the direction of the spiral and to hopefully constrain the viewer’s eyes. There are 3 exceptional points that are likely starting points for reading the graphic: the title, the center, and the omicron outbreak. 
				To avoid introducing other locations, I’ve lightened the texts for 7-day average (inspired by the first sketch) and the September and August months. I’ve also left white space on all the corners except for the title corner to reduce stray entry directions into the center. 
				The most desirable reading is first the title, from which naturally follows the scale (out of context for now), then white space, at which it’s likely the eyes are brought to another of the 2 exceptional points. Hopefully, the eyes pass over the 200k scale annotation before reaching the middle, this was intentional. 
				Once in the middle, if the viewer did not notice the outer calendar, they will likely still see the 3 months Feb, March, April…, and they will still get the understanding of a calendar. They then next see up to 3 scattered scale bars to understand the area and give time footholds, hitting the omicron section. 
				If they started in the omicron section, then by default they should at least know the scale. I include the August and September months as a backup for “Omicron-starters” to understand the calendar reasonably quickly. Since the months don’t continue past October, I hope that the eyes are shuttled either to the title or to the center. 
				The three different starting points all give the viewer answers to the 3 criteria I specifically wanted to fix within a tolerable amount of time. There was a major trade off between using a novel graphic and clarity of information. It aligned better with my make-believe scenario of wanting viewers to lean into the novel graphic. 
				In defense of the spiral graphic, a perfectly clear line chart that no one reads conveys ironically no information at all. Did you spend the time to read the line chart they provided later in the original article? 
				In the end I was not able to find a way to have both the spiral and also convey magnitudes across points, which was part of my original critique. I tried adding a color-code like in sketch 3 (see Appendix A), which works great if you’ve already seen the original graph. 
				However, if you don’t know how to read the graph already, there’s too much information clutter and it ends up defeating the point of a great “first glance.” The process of critique by design definitely helped by giving specific goals to work towards instead of vaguely trying to make it better.
				By listing my priorities and values out, I had a framework to make decisions later which felt more cohesive.

			<h2>Data Cleanup and Transformations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Removed lone 12/31/22 date with negative cases</li>
				<li>Implemented a 7-day moving average. Centered the point in the middle. Except for the 3 first and last points, for which I used the 7 days that were in frame. Note that this duplicates the values for that, but they represented a small fraction (6/1000) of the points</li>
				<li>Normalized the data to the largest 7-day average (806,868)</li>
				<li>Had to generate a new list of values index-shifted by 1 to give the curve function a way to know where to go</li>
				<li>Had to join (cartesian product) the data with a set of {1, 2, 3, 4} to create data duplicates to make the plotting work</li>
				<li>Rotate out by the initial data starting on Jan 13th instead of Jan 1</li>
			</ul>
